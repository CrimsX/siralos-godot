//! The fail-closed GDScript language-session service.
//!
//! On this stage engine startup is fail-closed, so no trusted engine can
//! ever be selected: every preparation truthfully reports `unsupported`
//! before requesting approval, opening a port, or creating a mirror, and
//! the bounded session status stays `unavailable`. The designed flow —
//! prepared-session freezing, one-time approval, revalidation, loopback
//! startup, framed queries — becomes reachable only when a mechanically
//! identity-bound launch primitive exists; that machinery lands with that
//! milestone rather than as unreachable code.

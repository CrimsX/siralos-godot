//! Authoritative read-only GDScript diagnostics service.
//!
//! On this stage engine probing is fail-closed, so no trusted engine can
//! ever be selected: every preparation truthfully reports `unsupported`
//! before requesting approval, execution refuses before creating a mirror
//! or launching Godot, and nothing is ever created or deleted. The
//! designed flow — static validation, digest freezing, one-time approval,
//! revalidation, sequential mirrored checks — becomes reachable only when
//! a mechanically identity-bound launch primitive exists; the deeper
//! machinery lands with that milestone rather than as unreachable code.
